# Tic-Tac-Toe
  A project that feature the famous game Tic-Tac-Toe.

  **Tic-tac-toe** (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a 
paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The 
player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins
the game.

  In order to run the game, we need to first, navigate directories, using command line, to where the 
game folder is stored, once there navigate to the bin directory and execute the following line of code
ruby user-interface.rb.
